#Simple Chat Client with GUI

This is based on this code: http://www.di.ase.md/~aursu/ClientServerThreads.html

It's almost pure GUI. You need to connect to the Server via console or command line.

How to Run via Command Line:
  1. javac *.java
  2. java Server
  3. java Client
  4. It will ask you what IP do you want to connect to: enter 127.0.0.1. The Client connects to the server.
  5. Repeat steps 3-4 to add more clients
